/**
 * Created by 刘灿锐 on 2017/3/11 0011.
 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
 *
 * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
 * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 * For example,
 *
 * Consider the following matrix:
 *
 * [
 * [1,   3,  5,  7],
 * [10, 11, 16, 20],
 * [23, 30, 34, 50]
 * ]
 * Given target = 3, return true.
