 * Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
 * What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
 *
 * For example,
 * Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
 *
 * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
