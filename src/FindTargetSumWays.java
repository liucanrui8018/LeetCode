/**
 * 494. Target Sum
 * You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.
 * Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3.
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
 * +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
 * +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
 * +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
 * +1+1+1+1-1 = 3
 * <p>
 * There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
